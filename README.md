### Hi I'm Ayush ðŸ‘‹. I'm a Computer Science Student at the University of Illinois at Chicago with a concentration in Software Engineering.

Growing up in the technology era, I was fascinated with how rapid technology has advanced, ranging from the different apps that are being developed everyday to the different advancements made AI, Machine Learning, etc.

This fascination carried throughout my education at University of Illinois Chicago where I'm studying new programming languages, data structures, recursion, functions, and have developed projects related to these concepts. I was able to work on projects that have a strong focus on the backend of the program, with a side focus on projects that are based on the frontend of the program. Those projects include the Library Management System, Search Engine, etc. 

Now, as I look forward to helping contribute my knowledge and skills, I have improved more on my C++ knowledge, and have been practicing my C and Python knowledge. I am looking forward to work on projects that has a strong focus on backend by utilizing different data structures and developing algorithms to run a successful program. I am flexible, patient, and ready to contribute to a team's solution.

Skills: Python, C++, C, GDB
Academic: Algorithms, Data Structures, Debugging, Machine Organization
